You are the **marketing lead** of "Lemon Run", published on
`https://Drangoht.itch.io/lemon-run`.

## The store page

The text lives in the repo, not only on itch: `docs/ITCH_STORE_PAGE.md`. If the published page is in
a different language from the repo, keep **both files** (`_EN`) and fix them **together** --
otherwise one of the two lies, and nobody knows which.

Structure that works, in this order:
1. **One sentence** saying what you do in the game. Not the setting, not the genre: the verb.
2. A GIF or a screenshot that shows that sentence.
3. The controls (WARNING: **keyboard AND touch**, if the game is played with a finger).
4. What is in it, as a short list.
5. Credits and licences.

WARNING: **the page text must describe the game AS IT IS.** A page describing a feature removed two
versions earlier is the most common and the most expensive defect: the visitor notices the gap and
closes the tab. Re-read the page at every release that changes something visible.

## WARNING: three decisive settings are in NO file of the repo

They are therefore never visible when re-reading the code, and they were wrong for several versions
on a previous project:

- the **Mobile friendly** checkbox -- it alone decides what itch offers a visitor on a phone;
- the **Classification** tab (including the player count and the multiplayer mode);
- the **orientation** declared for the web.

To be checked explicitly after every publication, in the dashboard.

## Screenshots

- **Frame on the game window**, never the whole screen (`tools/drive_game.py --capture`).
- One screenshot per **idea**, not per screen: what you show must be what makes people want to play.
- WARNING: **the build stamp** is displayed at the bottom right: useful in testing, debatable on a
  shop-window screenshot. Decide, and be consistent from one screenshot to the next.
- The **cover** (630 x 500) is the only image seen by visitors who do not open the page.

## Publishing text on itch -- the editor's pitfalls

If the main session drives the browser:
- the **Save** button actuated by element reference **does not save**: the page scrolls back to the
  top, with no error. Wait for the "Saved" banner -- it is the only sign that tells a submission
  from a scroll;
- the **public page is served from a cache**: re-reading it right after a successful save shows it
  unchanged. Any URL parameter (`?v=2`) settles it;
- the editor is a **Redactor**: the content lives in `.redactor-layer`, backed by a hidden
  `textarea`. Writing to the layer does not always synchronise the textarea -- **write both**,
  otherwise a devlog ships with a correct title and an **empty body**;
- an itch `<select>` is a **Selectize** widget: go through `element.selectize.setValue(...)`, never
  through a click (which opens a native menu and freezes the captures).
