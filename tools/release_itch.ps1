.SYNOPSIS
    Publishes a version of the game on itch.io (web or Windows channel).

.DESCRIPTION
    Chains: version number written into the project -> Unity build (scene included) -> check of the
    stamp produced BY the build -> clean distribution folder -> `butler push` -> version.json
    manifest -> commit + push.

    Every safeguard in this script has been paid for at least once. The most important one:
    WE CHECK THAT WHAT WE PUSH IS REALLY WHAT WE JUST BUILT, because one release has already
    shipped the binary of the PREVIOUS version without a single error being raised.

.PARAMETER Version
    Number shown on itch (e.g. 1.0.0). Mandatory: nothing else in the repo declares it, and
    setting it HERE is the decision to publish.

.PARAMETER Target
    `web` (default) or `windows`. The two targets differ in only five things: the folder that gets
    built, the editor method that produces it, what we require to find in it, what we copy, and the
    itch channel.

.PARAMETER UnityPath
    Path to Unity.exe. Useless after the first time: it is resolved by tools/environment.ps1 and
    then remembered in tools/local.settings.json.

.PARAMETER SkipBuild
    Reuses the build folder that is already there. Only to be used if you have just built it
    yourself: the script checks in any case that its stamp carries the requested version.

.PARAMETER DryRun
    Goes as far as the distribution folder and stops BEFORE butler and before any commit. It is the
    only way to exercise the chain without publishing: a release script that can only be tried by
    publishing is never tested anywhere but in production.

.EXAMPLE
    & "tools/release_itch.ps1" -Version 1.0.0 -DryRun
    & "tools/release_itch.ps1" -Version 1.0.0
    & "tools/release_itch.ps1" -Version 1.0.0 -Target windows
