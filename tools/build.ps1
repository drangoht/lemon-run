.SYNOPSIS
    Builds the game from the command line, without opening the editor.

.DESCRIPTION
    The single entry point of the build chain: this is the command the README, the agents and the
    skills all quote. Nobody types Unity's path by hand any more -- it is resolved by
    tools/environment.ps1 and then remembered.

    The script refuses to start if the editor is open, requires the success ANNOUNCED by BuildTools
    in the log (a zero exit code does not tell "built" apart from "nothing to do"), then prints the
    stamp of the binary it produced.

.PARAMETER Target
    `windows` (default), `web`, or `all` to chain both.

.PARAMETER UnityPath
    Path to Unity.exe. Useless after the first time: it is remembered in
    tools/local.settings.json (not versioned).

.PARAMETER Run
    Chains on to tools/drive_game.py: launches the Windows build and captures the screen. That is
    the difference between "it compiles" and "I saw it running".

.PARAMETER Method
    Calls an editor method instead of building -- typically a THROWAWAY file dropped into
    Assets/Editor to measure some geometry that cannot be proven by playing. Saves having to look
    up Unity's path for that single use.

.EXAMPLE
    & "tools/build.ps1"
    & "tools/build.ps1" -Target web
    & "tools/build.ps1" -Run -Capture docs/check.png
    & "tools/build.ps1" -Method LemonRun.EditorTools.Measures.Check
    & "tools/build.ps1" -UnityPath "<unity-folder>\<version>\Editor\Unity.exe"
