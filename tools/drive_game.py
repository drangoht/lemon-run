"""Launches the Windows build, injects real input into it, and captures its window.

Why this tool exists
--------------------
"It compiles" proves nothing about a game. An inverted key mapping, a character stuck in a wall, a
ball flying off screen, a menu that does not react: none of these defects show up at compile time,
and all of them are visible in thirty seconds on a screenshot of the running game.

This script makes that possible **without opening the editor and without a human hand** -- so
inside an agent loop. Every safeguard it contains matches a wrong conclusion that has already been
drawn.

Usage
-----
    py tools/drive_game.py --launch --wait 4 --capture docs/check.png
    py tools/drive_game.py --keys "enter,down,down,enter" --capture docs/menu.png
    py tools/drive_game.py --hold right --duration 1.2 --capture docs/movement.png
    py tools/drive_game.py --close

Screenshots are scaled down to 960 px wide (see CAPTURE_WIDTH): they are read by an agent, and an
image costs in proportion to its area. Use `--full-resolution` for fine detail.

Pitfalls already paid for (do not rediscover them)
--------------------------------------------------
1. **Focus is THE blocking point.** `SetForegroundWindow` alone fails from a non-interactive shell:
   the window stays in the background and Unity then receives **no key at all**. What works:
   injecting a real click into the window, which earns it the foreground legitimately. Always check
   `GetForegroundWindow() == hwnd` before concluding anything.
2. **`keybd_event` must carry the SCAN CODE**, not just the virtual key code: Unity's input system
   reads the raw input.
3. **Arrow keys require `KEYEVENTF_EXTENDEDKEY`**: without it, their scan code is the numeric
   keypad's and the key is silently lost.
4. **The very first key after launch is lost** (the game has just taken focus): this script
   therefore always primes with a throwaway key.
5. **The Unity splash screen lasts ~2 s**: capturing before that is capturing a logo.
6. **The Windows firewall opens a modal alert on the first launch of EVERY new exe path.** It
   steals focus and greys out the window. Close it (`Get-Process PickerHost`) then relaunch, or
   always rebuild to the same path.
7. **Do not hard-code the position of the elements you aim at.** A menu that moved makes the clicks
   land in the void -- with no error, just a screenshot showing something other than expected.
8. **Settings are persistent (PlayerPrefs).** Driving an option with N presses on Right gives a
   result *relative* to the previous session: go back to a known extreme first.
