"""Serves the web build locally, WITHOUT browser cache.

Why this tool rather than `python -m http.server`
-------------------------------------------------
Unity's WebGL output files always carry the same name from one build to the next
(`web.wasm.unityweb`, `web.data.unityweb`). Python's built-in server sends no `Cache-Control`: the
browser then applies its own freshness heuristic and serves what it has in memory. After a rebuild,
it can therefore pair the `.data` of one build with the `.wasm` of another.

The symptom is not "stale version". It is, at startup:

    Loading failed: RuntimeError: memory access out of bounds
      at wasm://wasm/0b2ac7ce:wasm-function[97296]:0x1712ca9
      ... three hundred lines of offsets, not a single method name ...

An hour has already been lost looking for that in the game code. The build does set a cache buster
(`BuildTools.StampWebCacheBuster`), but it lives in `index.html` -- and if the host page itself
comes out of the cache, the cache buster still points at the old build's files. An invalidation
mechanism carried by a cacheable resource cancels itself out: it needs a non-cacheable root, and
only a real HTTP header gets that. HTML `http-equiv` tags are not enough, Chrome ignores them for
the main document.

Usage
-----
    py tools/serve_web.py                  # http://localhost:8080
    py tools/serve_web.py --port 9000
    py tools/serve_web.py --dir Build/Web

WARNING: if the game stays broken while this server is running, the browser cache is already
polluted by a previous session: changing the port gives a fresh origin, hence a clean cache.
