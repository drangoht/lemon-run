description: Build Lemon Run from the command line, launch it, inject real input into it and capture the screen -- to see that a change actually works instead of concluding that it compiles. To be invoked after any change to gameplay, UI, rendering or controls, and every time you are about to write "that should work".

# Verify by launching the game -- Lemon Run

> **"It compiles" proves nothing about a game.** An inverted key mapping, a character stuck in a
> wall, a menu that does not react, scenery rendered entirely black: none of these defects show up
> at compile time, and all of them are visible in thirty seconds on a screenshot of the running
> game.

Everything is driven **without opening the editor**.

## 1. Build

```powershell
& "tools/build.ps1"              # Windows -> Build\Windows\LemonRun.exe
& "tools/build.ps1" -Target web  # Web     -> Build\Web
& "tools/build.ps1" -Run         # ... then launches the game and captures the screen
```

The build enables URP, regenerates `Assets/Scenes/Game.unity` from `SceneBuilder`, compiles, and
writes its log to `Logs\build-<target>.log`.

WARNING: **do not invoke `Unity.exe` directly.** Its path is not the same from one machine to the
next (`Program Files`, or any drive through the Hub's *secondary install path*); hard-coded, it
gives "Unity.exe : The term 'Unity.exe' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet". `build.ps1`
resolves it, remembers it, and covers the three pitfalls below.

WARNING: **the build fails if the Unity editor is open** ("another Unity instance is running"):
`build.ps1` then refuses to start. **Never kill the editor** -- either wait, or work on a copy of
`Assets` + `Packages` + `ProjectSettings` in the scratchpad.

WARNING: in PowerShell, launching Unity with the `&` operator returns **immediately without doing
anything**: `Start-Process -Wait` is required.

WARNING: the **first** build imports the whole project (several tens of minutes) and generates
`Library/` and `ProjectSettings/` -- nothing to open in Unity Hub beforehand. The following ones are
fast.

## 2. Launch, act, capture

```
py tools/drive_game.py --launch --wait 4 --capture docs/check.png
py tools/drive_game.py --keys "enter,down,down,enter" --capture docs/menu.png
py tools/drive_game.py --hold right --duration 1.2 --capture docs/movement.png
py tools/drive_game.py --close
```

The script launches the exe **windowed** (full screen makes capture and focus unreliable), gives it
focus with a real click, primes with a throwaway key, then acts.

WARNING: **a screenshot costs to read** (~700 tokens each, and a verification loop chains ten of
them). Two habits:
- **Capture a lot, open only what settles the question.** The PNGs stay on disk: they are re-read on
  demand, they are not all scrolled through just to note that the menu is displayed.
- Screenshots are scaled down to 960 px wide by the script -- enough to judge a position, a screen
  state or some text. `--full-resolution` only for a pixel-level detail (aliasing, fine alignment),
  and then only once.

## The eight pitfalls -- each has already produced a false conclusion

1. **Focus is THE blocking point.** Out of focus, Unity receives **no** key and no mouse movement:
   the test lies silently. `SetForegroundWindow` alone fails from a non-interactive shell -- only a
   **real click** in the window gives focus legitimately. Always check
   `GetForegroundWindow() == hwnd` before concluding anything.
2. **The very first key after launch is lost.** Prime with a press and release.
3. **Injected keys must carry the SCAN CODE** (Unity's input system reads the raw input, not the
   virtual key code), and **arrow keys additionally require `KEYEVENTF_EXTENDEDKEY`**: without it,
   their scan code is the numeric keypad's and the key vanishes with no error.
4. **`SetCursorPos` is not enough for the mouse**: it moves the cursor on screen without putting
   anything into the input stream. Use `SendInput` with `MOUSEEVENTF_MOVE | MOUSEEVENTF_ABSOLUTE`,
   coordinates normalised over 0..65535, in small steps.
5. **An instant press only tests `wasPressedThisFrame`.** Anything that requires holding (movement,
   continuous navigation) needs `--hold`. Concluding "the arrow keys do not work" from an instant
   press is wrong: it is the tool, not the game.
6. **The Unity splash lasts ~2 s**: ignore the first frames.
7. **The Windows firewall opens a modal alert on the first launch of EVERY new exe path.** It steals
   focus and greys out the window. Close it (`Get-Process PickerHost`) then relaunch, or always
   rebuild to the same path.
8. **Settings are persistent (PlayerPrefs).** Driving an option with N presses gives a result
   *relative* to the previous session: go back to a known extreme, then **read the value back on
   screen**.

WARNING: **do not hard-code the position of the elements you aim at.** An overhaul that moves a
button makes the clicks land in the void -- with no error, just a screenshot showing something other
than expected. Re-read the position on a screenshot before replaying an old script.

## When the eye is not enough

- **Pixel analysis** for what is too fast or too fine ("is the ball leaving the frame?").
  WARNING: frame the scanned area **outside the HUD** and exclude every known element by its hue:
  twice in a row, too wide a threshold led to a false conclusion (a centroid contaminated by the
  scenery, then a count of light pixels that was counting the white HUD text). **Then look at the
  image.**
- **A long enough capture window**: 1.5 s often falls entirely inside a pause. Sweep 20 s and more,
  analysing on the fly rather than keeping the bitmaps (90 frames is about 350 MB).
- **Provoke the case**: a mechanic that only triggers on demand cannot be measured at random.
  Compare three columns -- before, after in passive play, after in provoked play. It is the
  "passive" column that proves nothing was broken.
- **What is pure geometry cannot be proven by playing**: write a **throwaway** file in
  `Assets/Editor`, call it with `-executeMethod`, log the points framing the bound to within two
  pixels -- then delete it. That is what caught a rejection zone three times too wide, whose formula
  nevertheless read perfectly.
- **For audio, measure the output** (`AudioListener.GetOutputData` + RMS), not the calls.
- **Read the player's `-logFile`** at the end: that is where runtime exceptions come out.

## Checking the web version

```
py tools/serve_web.py            # http://localhost:8080, WITHOUT browser cache
```
WARNING: do not use `python -m http.server`: after a rebuild, the browser pairs the `.data` of one
build with the `.wasm` of another, and the game dies on a `RuntimeError: memory access out of
bounds` three hundred lines of offsets long, which looks nothing like a cache problem.

From Chrome (`claude-in-chrome` skill):
- **an instant press only triggers `wasPressedThisFrame`** -- for a hold, dispatch the event
  yourself (Unity does not filter `isTrusted`):
  ```js
  const c = document.querySelector('canvas');
  const o = {key:'a', code:'KeyA', keyCode:65, which:65, bubbles:true, cancelable:true};
  c.dispatchEvent(new KeyboardEvent('keydown', o));
  await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 900));
  c.dispatchEvent(new KeyboardEvent('keyup', o));
  ```
- **Desktop Chrome provides NO `Touchscreen`**: `Touchscreen.current` stays `null` and any touch
  code exits immediately, with no error. Only **`?touch`** (which enables `TouchSimulation`) makes
  touch testable -- and it then responds to **real** clicks, not synthetic ones. To prove that a
  movement button responds, `left_click_drag` from one point to another **of the same button**: the
  hold lasts long enough to produce a visible movement.
- **Synthetic `PointerEvent`s do not reach uGUI** (unlike `KeyboardEvent`s).
- **The itch.io iframe is cross-origin**: nothing gets into it. Open the iframe URL directly in a tab
  (`document.querySelector('iframe').src`) -- there, everything becomes drivable again.

## WARNING: AZERTY keyboard

`KeyCode` (old Input Manager) and `Key` (Input System) both designate a **physical position on a
QWERTY keyboard**, never the printed character. `Key.A` / `Key.D` / `Key.W` place the controls under
the keys marked **Q / D / Z** on a French keyboard -- that is the intended result, not a bug. Avoid
`A`, `Q`, `Z`, `W`, `M` for global shortcuts; prefer `Tab`, `R`, the digits or the arrow keys.
